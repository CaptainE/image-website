# The Toolshop
Lab manager Morten Engell-Nørregård. Mobile: 51302790, mail: mort@di.ku.dk Office UP1 3-0-01B

the ultra short version is: clean up after yourself! and do not do anything before having spoken to the lab manager.

the slightly longer version below:

the image tool shop is a shared workshop for everybody working in the Image group. 
This means that alot of people are using the facilities simultaneously, so please clean up after yourself every time you leave the tool shop.

# facilities

We have the following facilities at our disposal (expect this list to grow as we grow the lab.)

__for all equipment it is important that you have been cleared to use it. An online course for safety instructions are forthcoming , but until then do not use any equipment before having been cleared by the lab manager. This is for your own (and everybody elses safety)
if you want to use any of the equipment or tools please contact the lab manager. He will be happy to instruct you in the use of any and all equipment in the tool shop.__

__Soldering equipment__ for making electronics prototyping, robotics or similar prototypes, including an assortment of components, both electrical and mechanical.
even though these are available for everyone to use it is important that we keep track of or current stock and make sure that projects pay for more expensive components so please make sure to coordinate with the lab manager. PLease do not solder the prototype boards to anything, they have pins for a reason so they may be reused. if you need more permanent setups make sure 
if you need any specific commponent the lab manager can also help with requisitioning these.

__Silicone casting equipment.__ Currently this is mainly used in regards to soft robotics but other uses could be thought of. Contact the lab manager if you have any questions or ideas for how you could use this. 

__3d print.__ we have 4 big FDM(fused deposition modelling/filament) 3d printers as well as a few smaller ones. The printers are usually loaded with either TPU or PLA, but please make sure you know which filament is loaded before starting a print. We recommend using Cura and it is also a good idea to get your own micro sd card. That way you can avoid your precious gcodes from being erased.


__Storage and trash:__
we have a number of clear plastic boxes where you can store your project safely. put your name , contact info and start-date on the box so that way we can clear out or reuse old projects and avoid clutter.
If for some reason your project is to large to fit in any of the boxes, contact the lab manager to agree on a solution that is not impeding other users.

there is a specific trashbin for pla plastic (from the 3d printers) this is to be used only for PLA! other trash (apart from dangerous trash (e.g. chemicals and electronics))should be put in the normal trashbins that will be emtied by the cleaning staff. Anything that doesnt fit in any of these two categories contact the lab manager to be instructed on disposal.

__The rest.__
if you have larger projects you need to do in the toolshop or have any questions regarding how to go about your projects the lab manager is there to help so please reach out.

we also have access to a laser cutter, a resin printer and a cnc mill(primarily for pcb milling) as well as AR and VR equipment in the HCC labs(link) but since these are situated in a different location these are not readily available so make an appointment with the lab manager if you need to use these in your projects.
